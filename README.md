# Boltzmann Machines PyTorch
A Boltzmann machine is a type of stochastic recurrent neural network and Markov random field.

Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield networks. They were one of the first neural networks capable of learning internal representations and are able to represent and solve difficult combinatoric problems.
